# Google Salesforce Connector

Salesforce connector library for Dialogflow fulfillment(Node JS)

# Getting Started

Developers can leverage this library by importing it in their projects to do seamless integration with Salesforce instance.

## Pre-requisites

Following is the list of prerequisites required for configuring this library.

>**Node JS** : Node JS is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript run time environment.

>**User ID & Password** : User must have a valid user ID and password to log in to the Salesforce application.

>**Security Token** : It is a case-sensitive alphanumeric key that is used along with a username and password to access Salesforce via an API call. This security token is sent along with the user Id, password while making an API call.

The Steps for generating a Security Token are:

**Step 1:** Login to Salesforce Developers Account and navigate to your name at the top right corner of the title bar. Click on it, a drop-down menu appears.

**Step 2:** Click on the My Settings option. The Personal Information screens loads.

**Step 3:** From the left side menu under the My Personal Information section click on the Reset My Security Token option. The Reset Security Token screen appears.

**Step 4:** Now, Click on the Reset Security Token option.

**Step 5:** You will receive the Security Token on your registered Email Id. Store this security token safely on your local machine.

>**Note:** Whenever you change your password you need to change your security token as well.

Refer the image given below for accessing the Reset Security Token option.

## Installation

In this section, we will cover the installation of the **salesforce-connector** library. For installing **salesforce-connector** as a node dependency in your project, you require a _node package manager_. npm is the default package manager for the Javascript runtime environment Node.js.

For installing the library, open the command line terminal and navigate to your project location.  After this run the following command for installing the library package. Note that the name of the package here is salesforce-connector.

```
npm install https://gitlab.com/salesforce3/salesforce-connector
```
## Using the client library

To import the library in your Node JS project, run the following command. It invokes the constructor of the Connection class and uses the require method for importing the library modules.

```
'use strict';

const Connection = require('salesforce-connector');

const execute = async () => {
 const conn = new Connection({ logLevel: "INFO" });
 await conn.login({
	 username: "john@demo.com",
	 password: "*******",
	 security_token: "G6oNrdsw***********"
 });
 const queryResult = await conn.query("SELECT ID,NAME from ACCOUNT").run();
 console.log("Result : ", queryResult);
 await conn.logout();
};

execute();
```
   
# Methods

This section walks the user with the procedure to establish a connection and login to the Salesforce CRM application. It also details various queries developed for retrieving and modifying data present in the database.

    Promise< UserInfo > : Returns promise of type UserInfo.
    ```

## Query

We can query the salesforce database the following ways:

### 1. SOQL
SOQL is similar to the SELECT statement in the widely used Structured Query Language (SQL) but is designed specifically for Salesforce data. Using SOQL only fetching of data is possible. Functionalities like Create, Update, Delete etc can be done object Chaining method. SOQL uses query() of connection class.

**Specifications: query()**

- **Query**
    ```
    query(soql: String, options: Object?, callback: Callback<QueryResult>?): Query<QueryResult>
    ```

- **Parameters**

    - callback (Callback< QueryResult >?): Callback function

- **Returns**

    ```
    Query< QueryResult >  :  Returns string.
    ```

 #### 1.1. Run

The **query** method is used to fetch records from the Salesforce database. You can fetch the records by simply mentioning the column name and Table name you wish to extract data from in the SOQL query. An example where the records pertaining to the ID and name section from the Account table are fetched.

**Command**
```
const queryResult = await conn.query('SELECT ID,NAME from ACCOUNT').run();
```
**Specifications: run(options?)**

- **Query**

    ```
    run(options: Object?): Promise<QueryResult>
    ```

- **Parameters**

    options (Object?):This defines query options.
    
    | **Syntax** | **Description** |
    | --- | --- |
    | options.max Fetch Number?  | Max fetching records in auto fetch mode |
    | Options.headers Object? | Additional HTTP request headers sent in query request |

- **Returns**

    ```
    Promise<QueryResult> :  Returns Query Result.
    ```
### 2. Using Chaining Method

Method Chaining is a common technique where each method returns an object and all these methods can be chained together to form a single simple statement. CRUD operations can be performed using Chaining method on Salesforce objects. Additionally, basic SQL conditions like sortBy(), where(), limit(), skip() can be used in Chaining method while the fetching data from the Salesforce database using **collection** method.

**Specifications: collection()**
