        "This notebook is designed to help you create a SIP/SIPREC integration with CCAI. You can execute this notebook in the \"Colab Enterprise\" product within the Google Cloud Console. Note that you will need to enable some additional apis/services to run Colab Enterprise.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook is divided into 4 sections :\n",
        "1. Project setup :\n",
        "  - Specify your project details. If you are using a pre-generated JWT (from a Service Account for example) you can enter that here so that API calls are made using those credentials. We enable the Dialogflow API in the project using your credentials just in case it hasn't been done before in the UI.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Configuring CCAI for SIP/SIPREC :\n",
        "  - Create a dummy Dialogflow ES agent and set the tier to 'Enterprise' in order to override the free 'Trial' quota that is set up by default.\n",
        "  - Get a Google Phone Number, create a Security Settings object, create a ConversationProfile and associate the Google Phone Number with the ConversationProfile.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. SIP Trunk Management :\n",
        "  - Create a SIP TRUNK with your SBCs Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) as containted in the certificates used for authentication.\n",
        "  - Other methods to manage the SIP TRUNKs.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Utility functions :\n",
        "  - Get and List methods to view resources created.\n",
        "  - Delete method to delete resources created."
